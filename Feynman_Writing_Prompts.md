# Feynman Writing Prompts

Explanations:

* arrow functions: arrow functions are a shorthand way of writing functions. So instead of `listNums.forEach(function(param) { return param * param });`, this can be written as `listNums.forEach(param => param * param)`

* state: state is used for interactivity to track the values/properties of objects when they change

* constructor: called at the very beginning of the class and sets the initial state of the component

* setState - setState with a callback function and setState with an object passed in: used to change a component's state

* .bind: needed to bind methods to the current class

* functional components vs class components: similar however functional components are simpler. Classes have additional features

* onClick: is used so that when a button is clicked, something happens
